# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

README NOTES:
During the development of this React app, I harnessed the api using axios and component states. I planned to first handle Starships, and repeat similar logic for Vehicles and Film.

I tried several attempts to loop through the "starship" array in StarWars.js to attain data on more than one starship. In hindsight I should have considered treating this as a JSON object rather than an Array.

My connection to the api needs addressing, as when deploying the app, only a white screen appeared, however it worked fine locally. Therefore, I have commented out my output of the api starship data unfortunately, but in favour of displaying just a snapshot of my skills in css.

I have also included comments throughout my code of attempts and notes.

If I had more time to complete this task, I would address and perfect the following:

-- fix api endpoints
-- include a search form rather than just a button and improve the interactiveness of the app.
-- through the api, I could have used data from "planets" to control which currency to output on the "starships" and "vehicles" page, depending on which planet the manufacturer is from.
-- use grid or flexbox rather than table to display results.
-- vastly improve respoinsiveness.
-- included some background music, or animation for the results to enter into view mimicking the iconic Star Wars credits.
